    "The data was streamed using Unicorn LSL interface, which by itself outputs 17 raw channels (except \"Time\" and \"Events\" channels). Given channels were exported into CSV files without any modification. Event markers were streamed (also using LSL protocol) by NeuroPype™ Experiment Recorder (ER) software. Both of these streams were exported in XDF file format and then automatically synced using PyXDF library. As a result, \"Time\" and \"Events\" columns were added to the CSV files."
