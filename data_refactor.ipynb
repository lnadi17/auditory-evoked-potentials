    "## File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CSV file recording has 19 columns. Each column corresponds to an output channel acquired from the Unicorn Hybrid Black EEG device. There are different types of channels in the raw recording files: 1 time channel, 8 EEG channels, 3 accelerometer channels, 3 gyroscope channels, 1 counter channel, 1 validation channel, and 1 event channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, all the 19 channels are: Time, EEG_Fz, EEG_C3, EEG_Cz, EEG_C4, EEG_Pz, EEG_PO7, EEG_Oz, EEG_PO8, Accelerometer_X, Accelerometer_Y, Accelerometer_Z, Gyroscope_X, Gyroscope_Y, Gyroscope_Z, Battery_Level, Counter, Validation, Event.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Time* column indicates number of seconds passed since the start of the session.\n",
    "2. *EEG_\\** columns indicate unfiltered voltage values (in microvolts) for 8 EEG channels specified in Unicord Hybrid Black EEG device manual. For each EEG channel an electrode position is indicated (e.g. Cz) according to international 10-20 system.\n",
    "3. *Accelerometer_\\** columns indicate acceleration (±8 g) of the Unicorn Hybrid Black EEG device in X/Y/Z directions.\n",
    "4. *Gyroscope_\\** columns indicate the angular rotation (±1000 °/s) of Unicorn Hybrid Black EEG device in X/Y/Z directions.\n",
    "5. *Battery_Level* column value ranges from 0 to 100 and indicates the remaining battery level.\n",
    "6. *Counter* column tracks the sample order in which the values were received from Unicorn Hybrid Black to the host PC.\n",
    "7. *Validation* column is a validation indicator for the samples received from Unicorn Hybrid Black device.\n",
    "8. *Event* column indicates if any event was registered during the recording. Event descriptions for different experiment types can be found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about channels can be found in [Unicorn Hybrid Black User Manual](https://github.com/unicorn-bi/Unicorn-Suite-Hybrid-Black-User-Manual).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was streamed using Unicorn LSL interface, which by itself outputs 17 raw channels (except \"Time\" and \"Events\" channels). Given channels were exported into CSV files without any modification. Event markers were streamed (also using LSL protocol) by NeuroPype™ Experiment Recorder (ER) software. Both of these streams were exported in XDF file format and then automatically synced using PyXDF library. As a result, \"Time\" and \"Events\" columns were added to the CSV files."

    "## Filtered Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtered data is in \"Filtered_Data\" folder. The filtered data has the same CSV file format as the raw data. Only EEG channels are modified, other columns remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering of the EEG channels was done using the 0.5-60 Hz bandpass filter and 50 Hz notch filter. Both filters were designed with the MNE library as one-pass, zero-phase, non-causal filters using the windowed time-domain (firwin) method with a Hamming window."
